                                <div class="mini-course-description">Legal Use of Force mini course provides a clear, practical understanding of when and how force may be lawfully used for self-defense. This course breaks down complex legal concepts into real-world guidance, covering the elements of self-defense, use-of-force continuum, reasonable belief, avoidance and de-escalation, and the legal aftermath of a defensive encounter. This course is taught by Charles Milligan, who brings a calm, structured, and legally grounded approach to defensive decision-making. Students will leave with greater confidence in their ability to recognize lawful self-defense situations, make sound judgments under stress, and understand their responsibilities before, during, and after a use-of-force incident.</div>

                                <div class="mini-course-description">Developing a personal & home protection plan is a key component of not only preparing for how we should (or might) react if confronted by a violent crime, but also how we might avoid violent crime in the first place. Within this lesson, Charles Milligan explains that developing a protection plan is about much more than becoming proficient with a firearm or writing up a home invasion plan. It's a plan that must encompass awareness, avoidance, and preparation, so that we're less likely to find ourselves in a situation where we have no other option than to use our firearm, rather than more likely.</div>

                                <div class="mini-course-description">Self-Defense Firearms Basics mini course provides a clear, foundational understanding of the firearms most commonly used for personal protection. This course introduces students to the key features of semiautomatic pistols and revolvers, explaining how each platform operates and how they are safely handled. Students will learn the operating principles of common handgun actions, including single-action and double-action firearms, as well as an overview of manual and passive safeties. The course also covers proper loading and unloading procedures, helping students build safe, repeatable habits and confidence when handling defensive firearms.</div>

                                <div class="mini-course-description">Defensive Shooting Basics course provides students with a structured introduction to the core skills required for effective defensive handgun use—delivered entirely in a classroom environment using inert training methods. This course is taught without live ammunition and relies on training aids such as lasers, snap caps, and dummy firearms to safely develop fundamental defensive shooting skills. A significant portion of the class is dedicated to dry-fire drills, allowing students to focus on grip, stance, trigger control, sight alignment, presentation, and safe gun handling without the distraction of recoil or noise. Defensive Shooting Basics is designed to prepare students for live-fire range training, which is offered separately. By building correct mechanics and safe habits first, students arrive at the range better prepared, more confident, and ready to make efficient use of live-fire instruction.</div>

                                <div class="mini-course-description">Violent Encounters and the Aftermath mini course prepares students for the realities of a defensive encounter beyond the immediate physical threat. This course explores how violent incidents unfold, common physiological and psychological responses to stress, and how decision-making is affected before, during, and immediately after a defensive event. Students will also learn what to expect in the aftermath of a self-defense incident, including interactions with responding law enforcement, the importance of articulating actions clearly and responsibly, and considerations related to legal, emotional, and personal recovery. Emphasis is placed on situational awareness, avoidance, and responsible post-incident behavior.</div>

                                <div class="mini-course-description">Basic and Advanced Skills mini course builds on foundational handgun knowledge and introduces students to more refined defensive shooting techniques used in real-world personal protection. This course reviews essential skills such as grip, stance, sight alignment, trigger control, and safe gun handling, then progresses to more advanced concepts including efficient presentation from ready positions, recoil management fundamentals, shot accountability, and improved shooting consistency. Instruction emphasizes safe, repeatable techniques that enhance accuracy, control, and confidence under defensive conditions. The course is structured to benefit both newer shooters seeking reinforcement of the basics and more experienced students looking to sharpen and advance their core handgun skills. No real ammunition is used in this mini-class, but much of the time is spent on dry-fire drills using snap caps, lasers and other training aides.</div>

This course is especially valuable for individuals who live, work, or travel across state lines. The course is divided into three focused modules: Washington, DC – Concealed carry eligibility, firearm registration requirements, transport rules, prohibited locations, and use-of-force considerations; Maryland – Wear and Carry Permit requirements, firearm purchase and transport regulations, duty to retreat considerations, and prohibited places; Utah – Concealed carry laws, reciprocity considerations, permitless carry overview, and lawful carry and transport requirements. Students will gain a clear understanding of how state and local regulations differ, how to remain compliant when crossing jurisdictional boundaries, and why staying current on firearms law is essential for responsible carry. Emphasis is placed on practical application, legal awareness, and risk reduction.</div>
